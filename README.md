# This is a test repository

This repository has a unique objective, training me with the different git concepts and commands.

I went through the pull/push concepts. At first glance, it does not seems complicated.

Here also, this line will create a merge conflict.

I managed the conflict between both versions of `README.md`.
The text editor [Atom](https://atom.io) is aware of conflicts and displays the merging conflicts
with syntax highlighting!

Here a line to try `git stash`.

### Work with branches

Now I have to learn about branches:  
- the basics
- how can I use different branches
- how to switch between branches
- commit the work done on the different branches
- why I would work with such branches

A haiku has been added in the repo.
