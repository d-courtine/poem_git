# This is a test repository

This repository has a unique objective, training me with the different git concepts and commands.

I went through the pull/push concepts. At first glance, it does not seems complicated.

Here also, this line will create a merge conflict.

I managed the conflict between both versions of `README.md`.
The text editor [Atom](https://atom.io) is aware of conflicts and displays the merging conflicts
with syntax highlighting!
